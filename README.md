# String Field Date Validation Tool

  

#### A simple date validation tool, for any basic string input element(s), that validates dynamically as the end-user types in a UK date, and will reacts accordingly. It is designed to be as compatible as possible (both backwards & cross-browser), while covering all user inputs that could be attempted when typing in a date (both valid or invalid).

  ***

##### <i>For use as an extension/plugin to compensate for any Web Experience Platforms or Web Content Management & Deployment Systems that cease to support legacy browsers or browser versions. Can be embedded into most source code access points, where script execution is with the targeted element's DOM load.
##### The ES5 Versions provide most compatibility but are least 'modern', whereas the ES6 is using the latest ECMAScript (ES) and looks favorably towards modern browsers. All versions are, however, designed with compatibility (legacy and cross-UA) in mind.<i/>
