# String Field Date Validation Tool

  

#### A simple date validation tool, for any basic string input element(s), that validates dynamically as the end-user types in a UK date, and will reacts accordingly. It is designed to be as compatible as possible (both backwards & cross-browser), while covering all user inputs that could be attempted when typing in a date (both valid or invalid).

  ***

##### <i>For use as an extension/plugin to compensate for any Web Experience Platforms or Web Content Management & Deployment Systems that cease to support legacy browsers or browser versions.<i/>
