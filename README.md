# String Field Date Validation Tool

### A simple date validation tool, for any basic string input element(s), that validates dynamically as the end-user types in a UK date, and will reacts accordingly. It is designed to be as compatible as possible (both backwards & cross-browser), while covering all user inputs that could be attempted when typing in a date (both valid or invalid).
