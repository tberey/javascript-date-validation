<!-- DESCRIPTION / NOTES / PLANNING:

---------------------------------------------------------------[Version 1.0]---------------------------

A simple date validation tool, for any basic string input element(s), that validates dynamically as the end-user types in a UK date, and will react accordingly. It is designed to be as compatible as possible (both backwards & cross-browser), while covering all user inputs that could be attempted when typing in a date (both valid or invalid). See README.md for further information.

There are 13 functions in this file.
Function with the largest signature take 1 arguments, while the median is 0.
Largest function has 26 statements in it, while the median is 2.
The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity value of 41 while the median is 1.

1) Add drop down for US/other formats input functionality, to then output the UK date with the others.

2) Make it so that the button is the only way to focus and blur field. !(In-Progress)!

3) Check and (if required), add better mobile/table support, with Safari and Android Browsers.

4) Consider about restricting use of 30 or 31 days dependant on month, plus a leap year. Currently allows all months up to 31 days :S


Note: USE SELENIUM FOR CROSS USER AGENT TESTING.
